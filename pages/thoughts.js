               Some people&apos;s lives can be written into multiple books, span multiple Netflix seasons. Reading their wikipedia pages is thrilling—Chelsea Manning, Harriet Tubman, Ted Kaczynski, to name a few. Their lives do violate legalities and involve physical, harrowing struggles. But reading about it is an adventure in itself.<br/> <br/>

People enjoy hearing interesting stories about people&apos;s lives. That&apos;s why media is so popular (Anime, TikTok, Hollywood films)—people can vicariously live an exciting adventure. But why live vicariously when you can live it out for yourself?<br/> <br/>

Having an interesting life is easier than people think, if you make the conscious effort to do things that are interesting.<br/> <br/>

Example: I was deeply unhappy from November to January (college apps & a time-consuming class I despised). But when the storm passed, I wanted to take control of my life and live exciting adventures. I targeted common hobbies I had: going to the gym was getting mundane, so I decided to buy a half marathon ticket that was to take place in May, and the morning after our senior ball.<br/> <br/>

I was not a runner—I didn&apos;t sports in high school and I lifted weights at the gym. But when I bought the ticket and started training, I suddenly had a mountain to climb and a summit to reach. Some of my friends thought I was delusional, but that made the goal more enticing.<br/> <br/>

I missed the senior ball afterparty to sleep early, but I only got 3 hours of sleep before I scrambled to BART, sprinting through the doors as it closed. I was shitting my pants the entire train ride, because I hadn&apos;t been training the past 2 weeks due to an injury. My goal was quite literally to not get shuttled off the course and actually complete it.<br/> <br/>

But I ran the half marathon, across the West Oakland cranes, across the Bay Bridge and speeding cars. And it was one of the most surreal experiences ever. It is a core memory. It is part of my identity capital. It is a story I can tell forever, to anyone.<br/> <br/>

To me this is an interesting story, but something interesting for one person might not seem exciting from another&apos;s perspective. Personal growth is all that matters.<br/> <br/>

Of course I&apos;m not saying do things for the purpose of appeasing other people — that&apos;s something I dislike about social media, I don&apos;t want to revolve my life for the purpose of catering towards other people&apos;s interests. But doing crazy things that YOU would be captivated to hear from another person—living like that, in my opinion, makes life interesting. And I aspire to live an interesting, crazy life.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>

               Everyone says that life is a long long journey, that life is a marathon. <br/> <br/>

I was reading The 3 Body Problem, and I fell upon this passage:

“Ye felt this interminable wave was an abstract view of the universe: one end connected to the endless past, the other to the endless future…” The universe has an infinite timeline, and it&apos;s only a tiny break, a tiny glitch in the grand scheme of the universe, where I have time to live. <br/>  <br/>

If you think about it like that, it feels like there&apos;s a very finite time to get what I want in life. And I don&apos;t know when I will run out of the peaceful time I enjoy now, where my parents and I are safe and everything is real. The life I have now is stable, the life I want in the future is exciting—a tragic life disaster could upend it anytime. I can&apos;t shake off the sense of urgency to act optimally at every given moment. Perhaps long term it will bring more good than the anxiousness I have today. <br/>  <br/>

When I&apos;m 60 years old, I will dream about the time I was living today. Because the next 5 years of my life, may be the best in all my life. That&apos;s why everyday is a blessing, and every hour is invaluable—I have the uninterruptible freedom to live how I want, and the focused time to get what I want.<br/>  <br/>

Time itself is infinite, but my time is finite.
